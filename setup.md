You need to download some files to follow this lesson:

1. Make a new folder in your Desktop (or anywhere else you like) called `python-bcb546`. Download from these links by saving in your web browser. Or if you are in a unix terminal you can use `wget <url>` and replace the `<url>` with the path to the file you wish to download.
2. Download the following files into this folder:
    1. [surveys.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mesfind/bioinfo-python/gh-pages/data/surveys.csv)
    2. [species.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mesfind/bioinfo-python/gh-pages/data/species.csv)
    3. [surveys_complete.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mesfind/bioinfo-python/gh-pages/data/surveys_complete.csv)

Or, you can pull from the [course repository](https://github.com/mesfind/bioinfo-python) and change to the directory containing the data files:
1. ```$ mkdir bioinfo```
2. ```$ cd bioinfo```
3. ```$ git pull origin main```
4. ```$ cd bioinfo-python```


Or if you haven't yet cloned the course repository:
1. `git clone https://github.com/mesfind/bioinfo-python.git`
2. `cd bioinfo-python`
