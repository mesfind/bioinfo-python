# Starting with Data

We can automate much of our research workflow using Python. It's efficient to spend time
building the code to perform these tasks because once it is built, we can use it
over and over on different datasets that use a similar format. This makes our
methods easy to reproduce and easy to adapt to new projects. We can also share our code with colleagues
and they can replicate the same analysis.

### Getting Set Up

To help the lesson run smoothly, let's ensure everyone is in the same directory.
This should help us avoid path and file name issues. At this time please
navigate to the directory containing the [course repository](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/BCB546-Spring2022) on your computer. 
Before starting, be sure to **pull** the most recent changes from the repository using `git pull origin master`.
If you're working in Jupyter Notebook be sure
that you start your notebook in the `course-files/python` directory. If you do not have this directory, please see the instructions in the [Setup](../setup/) page.

You will want to use a Jupyter notebook or the Spyder IDE console to run this lesson. Both of these tools make it easy to view in-line plots.

To start a new Python session in a Jupyter notebook:

```
$ cd course-files/python
$ jupyter notebook
```

This typically brings up your default web browser and opens the Jupyter home screen.
Select **_New->Python 3_**. Name this session `03-starting-wtih-data`.

Note that you can also start a Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Navigator launch screen. This will likely open the notebook in your home directory and you can then navigate through your file system to get to the `course-files/python` directory.

Alternatively, you can start a Spyder instance and navigate to the `course-files/python` directory from the console using Unix commands. 



### Our Data 

For this lesson, we will be using the Portal Teaching data, a subset of the data
from the ecological study by Ernst et al. (2009):
[Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA](http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/default.htm)
Specifically, we will be using files from the [Portal Project Teaching Database](https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459).

* This section will use the `surveys.csv` file that can be downloaded from the 
[`course-files/python`](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/BCB546-Spring2022/tree/master/course-files/python) folder of the course repository.
Pull from the course repository and change to to `course-files/python` or copy the `surveys.csv` file to the directory from which you would like to work.

In this lesson, we are studying the species and weight of (_vertebrate_) animals captured in plots in our study
area. The observed data are stored as a `.csv` file (comma-separated value): each row holds information for a
single animal, and the columns represent:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record_id        | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot_id          | ID of a particular plot            |
| species_id       | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot_length  | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |


The first few rows of our first file look like this:

```
record_id,month,day,year,plot_id,species_id,sex,hindfoot_length,weight
1,7,16,1977,2,NL,M,32,
2,7,16,1977,3,NL,M,33,
3,7,16,1977,2,DM,F,37,
4,7,16,1977,7,DM,M,36,
5,7,16,1977,3,DM,M,35,
6,7,16,1977,1,PF,M,14,
7,7,16,1977,2,PE,F,,
8,7,16,1977,1,DM,M,37,
9,7,16,1977,1,DM,F,34,
```


## Pandas in Python
One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the
[Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (a.k.a. Pandas). The
Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and integrates nicely with other libraries
that use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (which is another Python library) arrays.

Python does not load all available libraries by default. We have to
add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import
a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the
library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as myNickName`.  

Import the pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below.


~~~
import pandas as pd
~~~
{: .python}

If you're using a Jupyter notebook for this lesson, it should look like this:

![Weight by Species Plot](../fig/03-name-jn.png)

Remember that the `import pandas as pd` syntax means that we have given the alias `pd` to the pandas library. Thus, we don't have to use the whole name when we invoke pandas functions.

# Reading CSV Data Using Pandas

We will begin by locating and reading our survey data which are in CSV format.
We can use Pandas' `read_csv` function to pull the file directly into a
[DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe).

## What's a DataFrame?

A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data of different
types (including characters, integers, floating point values, factors and more)
in columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or an SQL table or the `data.frame` in
R. A DataFrame always has an index (0-based). An index refers to the position of 
an element in the data structure.

[35549 rows x 9 columns]
~~~
{: .output}

We can see that there were 33,549 rows parsed into a DataFrame. Each row has 9
columns. The first column is the index of the DataFrame. The index is used to
identify the position of the data, but it is not an actual column of the DataFrame (it is not labeled). 

It looks like  the `read_csv` function in Pandas  read our file properly. However, we haven't saved any data to memory, and we cannot work with it until we do that.
We need to assign the DataFrame to a variable. 
Remember that a variable is a name for a value, such as `x`, 
or  `data`. We can create a new object with a variable name by assigning a value to it using the `=` operator.

Let's call the imported survey data `surveys_df`:

~~~
surveys_df = pd.read_csv("surveys.csv")
~~~
{: .python}

Notice when you assign the imported DataFrame to a variable, Python does not
produce any output on the screen. We can print the value of the `surveys_df`
object by typing its name into the Python command prompt. This will print the data frame just like above.

~~~
surveys_df
~~~
{: .python}


## Inspecting Our Species Survey DataFrame

Now we can start working with our data. First, let's check the data type of the
data stored in `surveys_df` using the `type` function. The `type` function and
`__class__` attribute tell us that `surveys_df` is `<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>`.

~~~
type(surveys_df)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
~~~
{: .output}

The output is the same if you use this:

~~~
surveys_df.__class__
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
~~~
{: .output}



We can also enter `surveys_df.dtypes` at our prompt to view the data type for each
column in our DataFrame. `int64` represents numeric integer values - `int64` cells
cannot store decimals. `object` represents strings (letters and numbers). `float64`
represents numbers with decimals.

~~~
surveys_df.dtypes
~~~
{: .python}


~~~
record_id            int64
month                int64
day                  int64
year                 int64
plot_id              int64
species_id          object
sex                 object
hindfoot_length    float64
weight             float64
dtype: object
~~~
{: .output}


### Useful Ways to View DataFrame objects in Python

There are multiple methods that can be used to summarize and access the data
stored in DataFrames. Note that we call the method by using
the object or method name `surveys_df.object` or `surveys_df.method()`. So `surveys_df.columns` provides an index
of all of the column names in our DataFrame.

## Summarizing Data in a Pandas DataFrame

We've read our data into Python. Next, let's perform some quick summaries of the DataFrame to learn more about the data that we're working with. We might want
to know how many animals were collected in each plot, or how many of each
species were caught. We can summarize different aspects of our data using groups. But first we need to figure out what we want to group by.

Let's begin by exploring our data and view the column names:

~~~
surveys_df.columns
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
Index(['record_id', 'month', 'day', 'year', 'plot_id', 'species_id', 'sex',
       'hindfoot_length', 'weight'], dtype=object)
~~~
{: .output}

Let's get a list of all the species. The `pd.unique` method tells us all of
the unique values in the `species_id` column. These are two-character identifiers of the species names (e.g., `NL` represents the rodent [_Neotoma albigula_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-throated_woodrat)).

~~~
pd.unique(surveys_df['species_id'])
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
array(['NL', 'DM', 'PF', 'PE', 'DS', 'PP', 'SH', 'OT', 'DO', 'OX', 'SS',
       'OL', 'RM', nan, 'SA', 'PM', 'AH', 'DX', 'AB', 'CB', 'CM', 'CQ',
       'RF', 'PC', 'PG', 'PH', 'PU', 'CV', 'UR', 'UP', 'ZL', 'UL', 'CS',
       'SC', 'BA', 'SF', 'RO', 'AS', 'SO', 'PI', 'ST', 'CU', 'SU', 'RX',
       'PB', 'PL', 'PX', 'CT', 'US'], dtype=object)
~~~

# Groups in Pandas

We often want to calculate summary statistics grouped by subsets or attributes
within fields of our data. For example, we might want to calculate the average
weight of all individuals per plot.

We can calculate basic statistics for all records in a single column using the
`.describe()` method:

~~~
surveys_df['weight'].describe()
~~~
{: .python}


~~~
count    32283.000000
mean        42.672428
std         36.631259
min          4.000000
25%         20.000000
50%         37.000000
75%         48.000000
max        280.000000
Name: weight, dtype: float64
~~~
{: .output}

We can also extract one specific metric if we wish:

Like the lowest `weight` 

~~~
surveys_df['weight'].min()
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
4.0
~~~
{: .output}

The maximum `weight`

~~~
surveys_df['weight'].max()
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
280.0
~~~
{: .output}

The `mean` of the `weight` column

~~~
surveys_df['weight'].mean()
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
42.672428212991356
~~~
{: .output}

The standard deviation of the `weight`

~~~
surveys_df['weight'].std()
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
36.63125947458399
~~~
{: .output}

Count the number of observations made for weight:

~~~
surveys_df['weight'].count()
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
32283
~~~
{: .output}

But if we want to summarize by one or more variables, for example the weight for each sex, we need to
use the Pandas DataFrame `.groupby()` method. Once we've created a re-orgaized DataFrame, we
can quickly calculate summary statistics by a group of our choice.

Group data by the sex of each observed individual:

~~~
sorted_data = surveys_df.groupby('sex')
~~~
{: .python}

The method `.describe()` will return descriptive stats including: mean,
median, max, min, std and count for a particular column in the data. Pandas'
`.describe()` method will only return summary values for columns containing
numeric data.
With the sorted data, we can obtain the summary statistics for the weight column separated by sex. 

~~~
sorted_data['weight'].describe()
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
       count       mean        std  min   25%   50%   75%    max
sex                                                             
F    15303.0  42.170555  36.847958  4.0  20.0  34.0  46.0  274.0
M    16879.0  42.995379  36.184981  4.0  20.0  39.0  49.0  280.0
~~~
{: .output}


We can also get the mean for each numeric-valued column, grouped by sex:

~~~
sorted_data.mean()
~~~
{: .python}

![Means grouped by sex](../fig/group_mean_jn-table.png)


<!--~~~
        record_id     month        day         year    plot_id  \

M    17754.835601  6.392668  16.184286  1990.480401  11.098282

M          29.709578  42.995379  

~~~
{: .output}
-->
The `.groupby()` method is powerful in that it allows us to quickly generate
summaries of categorical data.

## Quickly Creating Summary Counts in Pandas
{: #quicksumm }

Let's next count the number of samples for each species. We can do this in a few
ways, but we'll use `groupby` combined with a `count()` method.


~~~
species_counts = surveys_df.groupby('species_id')['record_id'].count()
species_counts
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
species_id
AB      303
AH      437
AS        2
BA       46
CB       50
CM       13
CQ       16
...
~~~
{: .output}


Or, we can also count just the rows that have the species "PL" (_Peromyscus leucopus_):

~~~
surveys_df.groupby('species_id')['record_id'].count()['PL']
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
36
~~~
{: .output}

## Basic Math Functions

If we wanted to, we could perform math on an entire column of our data. For
example let's multiply all weight values by 2. A more practical use of this might
be to normalize the data according to a mean, area, or some other value
calculated from our data.

Multiply all weight values by 2 and store values in a Pandas object called `double_weight`:

~~~
double_weight = surveys_df['weight'] * 2
~~~
{: .python}

If we summarize `double_weight`, then the summary will indicate that these values are twice the original weights:

~~~
double_weight.describe()
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
count    32283.000000
mean        85.344856
std         73.262519
min          8.000000
25%         40.000000
50%         74.000000
75%         96.000000
max        560.000000
Name: weight, dtype: float64
~~~
{: .output}

# Quick & Easy Plotting Using Pandas

We can plot our summary stats using Pandas, too. 

<!-- First, we must ensure that the plots will appear in our Jupyter notebook or IPython console (using Spyder):
~~~
%matplotlib inline
~~~
{: .python} -->

Now, we can make a quick bar chart of the species counts

~~~
species_counts.plot(kind='bar',title='Number of individuals per species')
~~~
{: .python}

![Weight by Species Plot](../fig/species-counts-bar.png)


We can also look at how many animals were captured in each plot:

~~~
total_count = surveys_df.groupby('plot_id')['record_id'].nunique()
~~~
{: .python}

And plot a bar chart describing the number of individuals captured at each plot. Also, let's make it so that all of the bars are colored green.

~~~
total_count.plot(kind='bar',title='Number captured per plot', color='green')
~~~
{: .python}

![Number Captured Plot](../fig/num-captured.png)

# More Fun with Plotting

Now we will plot something a little bit more difficult. We will use a stacked bar plot to show how both weight and sex are distributed across each plot in the study. 

First we group data by plot and by sex, and then calculate a total for each plot.

~~~
by_plot_sex = surveys_df.groupby(['plot_id','sex'])
plot_sex_count = by_plot_sex['weight'].sum()
plot_sex_count
~~~
{: .python}

This calculates the sums of weights for each sex within each plot as a table

~~~
plot  sex
plot_id  sex
1        F      38253
         M      59979
2        F      50144
         M      57250
3        F      27251
         M      28253
4        F      39796
         M      49377
...
~~~
{: .output}

Then we'll use `.unstack()` on our grouped data to figure out the total weight that each sex contributed to each plot.

~~~
plot_sex_count.unstack()
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
sex            F        M
plot_id                  
1        38253.0  59979.0
2        50144.0  57250.0
3        27251.0  28253.0
4        39796.0  49377.0
5        21143.0  23326.0
6        26210.0  27245.0
7         6522.0   6422.0
...
~~~
{: .output}

Now, create a stacked bar plot with those data where the weights for each sex are stacked by plot.

~~~
spc = plot_sex_count.unstack()
s_plot = spc.plot(kind='bar',stacked=True,title="Total weight by plot and sex")
s_plot.set_ylabel("Weight (g)")
s_plot.set_xlabel("Plot")
~~~
{: .python}
<!-- redo plot -->
